# AI Collaboration Playbook

## Purpose

This document defines how AI coding agents should contribute within the universal workflow. The goal is not merely faster generation. The goal is controlled, architecture-aligned execution that preserves business rules and system integrity.

## AI Operating Principles

- Treat `DOC/` as the authoritative source before making implementation decisions.
- Start with `DOC/Universal/Enterprise Level Guide/ai/ai-context.yaml` when you need a compact system map or a task-based read path.
- Do not invent business rules when a requirement is unclear. Raise the gap or document the assumption.
- Keep changes scoped to one module or one clearly related slice when possible.
- Prefer root-cause fixes over cosmetic patches.
- Update documentation when code changes alter behavior or assumptions.
- Treat frontend design-system, composition, and responsive rules as implementation constraints with pass-fail outcomes.
- Do not substitute personal aesthetic judgment for the documented visual rules and acceptance criteria.

## Required Context Order Before Coding

1. Read `DOC/Universal/Enterprise Level Guide/ai/ai-context.yaml` first.
2. Follow the relevant `read_paths` entry in that file for the target task.
3. Read workspace instructions in `.github/`.
4. Inspect existing code for current implementation patterns before editing.

## AI Rules for Domain Safety

- Never weaken role boundaries for convenience.
- Never implement priority queue logic without protecting idempotency and ordering.
- Never make delivered work public without an approval control.
- Never expose private storage objects directly without verifying access intent.
- Never let client-side state become the source of truth for project status.

## Expected AI Deliverables

For meaningful feature work, AI agents should produce or update:

- code changes
- tests for critical logic
- docs when contracts or rules changed
- migration or policy changes where needed
- concise rationale in the final summary

## Preferred Working Pattern

- Start by identifying the owning module.
- Identify affected data entities and API contracts.
- Implement domain service logic first for business rules.
- Connect UI only after server behavior and authorization are clear.
- Validate with tests or explicit reasoning about failure cases.

## Mandatory Validation Checklist

- Is authorization enforced server-side?
- Is there a documented source of truth for the state being changed?
- Are failure paths handled?
- Are side effects explicit and observable?
- Does the change preserve module boundaries?
- Do docs need updating?
- If frontend is affected, are DS rules, mobile behavior, and page-composition acceptance criteria satisfied?

## Prompting Guidance for Future AI Work

Good prompts should specify:

- module name
- affected user roles
- relevant business rule
- expected API or schema impact
- required tests
- starting reference: `DOC/Universal/Enterprise Level Guide/ai/ai-context.yaml`
- breakpoint expectations for mobile, tablet, and desktop when frontend is involved
- whether shared content/configuration must be updated instead of route-level hardcoding
- the relevant page-composition or hero standards when public UI is involved

Example:

"Start with DOC/Universal/Enterprise Level Guide/ai/ai-context.yaml. Implement the admin assignment workflow for queue management. Use the queue rules in DOC/Universal/Enterprise Level Guide, preserve admin-only assignment, create the project record transactionally, and add tests for duplicate assignment prevention."

## Anti-Patterns

- generating UI-first features without backend and policy alignment
- editing multiple domains without a unifying plan
- introducing undocumented status values
- bypassing payment verification in testable code paths
- scattering queue logic across pages, hooks, and handlers
- treating public UI docs as optional and shipping static, repetitive layouts that ignore composition rules
- implementing route-level copy, metrics, or CTA inventories inline when shared content/configuration is required
- skipping breakpoint validation for navigation, typography, alignment, and iconography

## Frontend-Specific Review Prompts

When asking AI to implement frontend work, prompts should explicitly require:

- the relevant DS and frontend docs to read first
- the canonical route or component scope
- the acceptance criteria for mobile navigation, iconography, hero composition, and state coverage
- confirmation that no hardcoded design values or content inventories are allowed

## Documentation Discipline

- If implementation clarifies a previously vague rule, update the relevant spec.
- If docs and code conflict, resolve the conflict explicitly instead of silently drifting.
