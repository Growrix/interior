# Universal Enterprise Guide Index

This directory is a reusable enterprise reference handbook for the universal workflow. Product-specific names that remain in some examples should be treated as reference context, not as scope limits on the standards.

For reusable workflow rules, prompt order, role routing, and implementation handoff, use these universal workflow sources first:

- `DOC/Universal/GPT ROLES/ai-context.yaml`
- `DOC/Universal/GPT ROLES/Documentation_Workflow_Playbook.md`
- `DOC/Universal/Prompts_planning/README.md`
- `DOC/Universal/Prompts_Execution/README.md`
- `DOC/Universal/Execution Constitution.md`

This handbook remains useful as a reference example for deeper product, architecture, operations, and quality patterns.

## Runnable MVP

The current codebase includes a local, self-contained Next.js MVP that implements the core Growrix OS flows without external credentials.

Use these commands from the repo root:

- `npm install`
- `npm run dev`
- `npm run verify`
- `npm run test:e2e`

Seeded accounts for local validation:

- Client: `client@example.com`
- Admin: `admin@growrixos.com`
- Developer: `maya@growrixos.com`

## AI First-Stop File

If an AI agent or prompt needs one starting reference, use [ai/ai-context.yaml](ai/ai-context.yaml) first.

Why this file exists:

- It is the compact, machine-readable index for the system.
- It summarizes core invariants, module ownership, status models, frontend and backend rules, and recommended read paths.
- It is the preferred file to reference in prompts when the model should find the right docs quickly instead of scanning the whole handbook.

Prompt guidance:

- For reference work in this universal handbook, start with `DOC/Universal/Enterprise Level Guide/ai/ai-context.yaml`.
- Then follow the relevant `read_paths` entry in that file before changing code or docs.

## Suggested Reading Paths

### For Product and Architecture Decisions

1. ai-context.yaml
2. product requirements
3. contract-first delivery
3. system architecture
4. module boundaries
5. data model and API design

### For Cross-Team Or AI Build Alignment

1. ai-context.yaml
2. contract-first delivery
3. product requirements
4. data model and API design
5. frontend and backend handbooks for the affected slice

### For AI Prompts

1. reference `DOC/Universal/Enterprise Level Guide/ai/ai-context.yaml`
